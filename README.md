Experimental [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension for showing a header at the top of the editor
indicating what context the top line is in as you scroll (e.g. function, media query, etc.). 
**Not ready for real use yet** (very slow when you make edits).

Requires the [nj/parse-mqs](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/tree/nj/parse-mqs) in Brackets.

TODO:
* make updates incremental
* fix line number display in header
* fix line number indent (so it's always consistent with main editor gutter size)
